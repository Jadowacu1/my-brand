          The significance of classifying matter in waste segregation is
          paramount. It not only helps in the reduction of waste sent to
          landfills but also promotes recycling and the conservation of valuable
          resources. In the context of high school education, teaching students
          the importance of waste segregation can be a valuable lesson in
          sustainable living, imparting lifelong skills for responsible waste
          management.

          In the field of high school teaching, waste generation is a
          significant concern. Schools produce various types of waste, including
          paper, plastic, organic materials, and more. To gain a better
          understanding, we've created a graph illustrating the distribution of
          waste types, which will help identify areas for improvement in our
          waste segregation practices.

        <!-- <h2>Sustainable School Waste Sorting Tips</h2>
        <p>
          Based on our research and insights from experts, we've developed a
          suggested waste segregation scheme for high schools. This scheme
          promotes the separation of waste into categories like recyclables,
          non-recyclables, and organic materials. In addition, it encourages
          students to be active participants in this process, fostering
          environmental awareness. By implementing these best practices, we aim
          to create a sustainable waste management system in high school
          settings that can serve as an example for the wider community.
